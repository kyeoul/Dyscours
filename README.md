# Dyscours
Dyscours is a platform for people of differing viewpoints to get together and discuss “the issues.” These can be political, pop culture, or really anything that is on your mind that you want a place to quickly chat about. A virtual marketplace of ideas, Dyscours is an anonymous but well-regulated platform where all can be heard. Dyscours is structured so that one will feel comfortable to speak from the heart and never feel threatened by others. However, we recommend a 17+ age window because anonymity should be used responsibly. Users can engage in one-on-one, text-based debates with our app, or they can choose to spectate other people debating. Our goal is to promote insightful conversations with the goal of understanding and persuasion.
